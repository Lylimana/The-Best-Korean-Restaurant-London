This is my project for all the korean restaurants in london. 

The aim for this project is to create a dashboard customers can use to find the best restaurants for them. 

The technologies I will be using in this project is: 

    Power query and Python for data cleaning and preprocessing. 

    Tableau for data visualisation. 

I have learnt from previous projects, the best way to improve in coding and data analysis is to not get caught up in one set of data. 
I aim to explore a wide range of data sets to develop my skills in data analysis and improve my adaptiblity to unknown data. 
I also intend to create something users can use to help them with decisions - in this case, finding the best korean restaurant in london.
